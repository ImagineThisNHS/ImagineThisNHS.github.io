# Background

Background elements are usually the last element within a view that covers the entire view.

The blue gradient, in the example below, shows a background element

## Styling
Any solid colour and shape will be recognised. 

Gradients are not supported at this time

## Naming
Background elements will need to be named  `background`. Additionally, it cannot contains other words such as `background 1` or `white background`.

However, the case of letters does not affect the recognition of component names; both `Background` and `background` are correct and accepted.

## Grouping
All elements and UI components need to be ordered above the background element within a group.
