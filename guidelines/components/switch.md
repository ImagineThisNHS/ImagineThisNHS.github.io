## Styling
No styling requirements. 
```note
The generated switch currently has a fixed default style for each OS, that can be adjusted by the developer on a global basis (by editing the generated reusable component).
```

## Naming & Grouping
Any element or group with a name that contains the word `switch` will be recognised as a switch toggle.
