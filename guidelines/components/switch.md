# Switch

Switch components are used to toggle the on/off a single setting.

## Styling
No styling requirements. Similar to the chart generation, the generated switch is a fixed swtich, which you can customize later, but we cannot recognize any variable of the swtich passed from the Figma API in the current version. 

## Naming & Grouping
Any element's name that contains `switch` will be recognised as a switch toggle. There are no speical type restrictions on the switch component.
