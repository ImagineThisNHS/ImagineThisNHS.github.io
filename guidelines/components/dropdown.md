# Dropdown 

## Styling
The design typically includes a rectangular border and a downward icon to indicate that this group represents a dropdown. However, there are no strictions on the style of the dropdown components

## Naming & Grouping
* The whole dropdown selector must be a group
* This group's name must contain `dropdown`
* Each group that represents a dropdown component must contains one and only one text with its name contains the word 'option'. 
* The text above will be extracted as the first option within the dropdown. There will be other default options generated along with it as placeholder, the user can add or rename them on the corresponding page if they want.

### Example of Naming & Grouping
The dropdown selector contains an option called “Football”. Therefore, the group name is dropdown, and it contains a text element named “option Football”.
