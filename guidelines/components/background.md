# Background

```note
Background elements are the last elemement with a group that is name `background`
```

Background is defined as having a background panel in the group. Therefore this element needs to be name `background` This is shown in the image below.

Once you have a whole set of components that are all on top of a background, and they are grouped together, that element is now the background.

## Styling
Any color and shape are accepted 

## Naming
Background naming rules are slightly stricter than others. Background must be named as `background` and cannot contains other words such as `background 1` or `white background`.

However, the case of letters does not affect the recognition of component names, both `Background` and `background` are correct and accepted.
