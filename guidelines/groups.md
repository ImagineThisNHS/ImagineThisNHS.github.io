# Groups, Frames, and Components

```warning
Only Groups are currently supported by this tool. You need to change all Frames and Components to Groups to allow for the best conversion to useable code.
```
Similar to other design tools, groups in Figma allow you to combine multiple elements as a single top-level layer.

In your Figma design, it’s possible that you also used two other functions that can combine many elements such as Frame and Component. However, these two combination methods are currently not support by this tool
