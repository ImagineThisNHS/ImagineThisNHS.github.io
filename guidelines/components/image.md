## Structure
Images are one of the most flexible components. They can be represented by a single bitmap image as in the example above. Or you can even have multiple elements/components of different types grouped together as an image. Our tool will simply render all the elements contained within as a bitmap.

_Example of an image group, containing multiple vectors_

## Styling
Any styling will be converted into a bitmap and made part of the image.

## Naming
* An Image should contain one of the words `image`, `icon` or `picture` within its name.
