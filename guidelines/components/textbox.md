# Text Box

## Styling
No styling requirements

## Naming and Grouping
* Textbox elements should be in a group.
* Name of the group for the textbox must contain `textbox`.
* Within the the group **must** include a rectangle (frame of the text box).
* This rectangle's name should include `rectangle`.

### Placeholders
* Placeholder text should be added within this group.
* The name of the text element needs to contain `placeholder`.

### Default Values
*  The default value of a textbox can be set via the name of text in addition to `placeholder`.
* For example, with a default value of 1000, the name of the text element with the group would be '1000 placeholder'
