_Example of the naming and grouping for sliders_

## Styling
No styling requirements, you can style the rectangle as you like to make the background of the slider look the same way on the frontend. 

## Naming & Grouping
The slider component should have a name with the word `slider` contains within it. The type of the slider should be Group.

Within the group, there should be three text sub-components:
* Maximum value of the slider exactly named as `max_value`.
* Minimum value of the slider exactly named as `min_value`.
* Current value of the slider exactly named as `cur_value`.

The Group accepts a Rectangle type component with its name being the exact word `background`
