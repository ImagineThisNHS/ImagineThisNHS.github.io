### Styling
A Figma element composed of a _shape (rectangle or circle)_ and _text_.

### Naming & Grouping
* The text button should be a group.
* The group name should contain the word `textbutton`.
* Besides text, the groups are also required to contain a rectangle or a cricle (we only support these two shapes right now).
