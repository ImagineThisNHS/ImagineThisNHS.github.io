## Styling
There are no styling requirements. The group should contain a rectangle to function as the container, style it accordingly in order to make the same style show up on the frontend code.  

## Naming and Grouping
* All the elements within the input components should be contained within a group.
* The name of the group should contain the word`input`.
* The group should contains a rectangle (container of the input field box).

## Placeholders
* Placeholder text should be added within this group.
* The name of the text element needs to contain `placeholder`.
