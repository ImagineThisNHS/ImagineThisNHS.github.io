# Interactions

```warning
Currently, only `onTap` animation within Figma are supported
```
A powerful feature of modern design prototype software is creating link and interactions. For instance, a link can be created between a button and a view. When the button is clicked/tapped, it will show the linked view. This provides rich interactions that can visually and interactively demonstrate how the final app would function during the prototyping phase. This is commonly used within Figma prototype design.

Once the designer has designed an interaction, these interactions can be recognised, and the necessary code can be generated using this tool.

## Limitations
### Interaction Types
Currently, the Imagine This tool only supports `On Tap` interactions. 

### Animations
Custom animations for interactions are not supported. However, the animation will have default behaviour for iOS and Android. For instance, a modal view within iOS has a default animation of sliding up from the bottom. In cases where there are no default animations, views will show instantly.
