# Bottom Navigation Bar

The bottom navigation bar provides quick navigation between the top-level views of an app.

## Styling
A rectangle is required within the navigation bar group to serve as a background.

## Naming & Grouping
The entire navigation bar should be organized into a group named "navigation bar".

Each button should be named according to the image button naming rules. For each of these buttons, they should be placed within their own seperate groups.
