## Styling
Form works like a grouping on the frontend that wrapps an additional <View> tag around the chosen inter form components. Here in our product we only supplies visual effect of a frontend form, nothing for the application backend will be added for now. The form should contain a rectangle or a vector inside its Group which function as the background on the  frontend. 


## Naming
* The whole form should be a Group, with required inner components as its elements. The inner components should follow its own corresponding instructions in this guideline, no further requirements are needed. 
* Right now, the component form will only reconize the following components inside as its inner components, any other components (specified or not specified by this Guideline) will no be generated insider the Form, even if they are in the Form Group.

Form Support Components (except its own background):
* Text button / Image button
* Chart
* Dropdown
* Images
* Input Field
* Slider
* Switch
* Text
