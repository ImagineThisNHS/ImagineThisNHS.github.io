# Input field
Input fields allow users to type in an app. Typically it is used within forms, send messages, search boxes, and more.

## Styling
There are no styling requirements. The group must contain a rectangle to function as the container, style it accordingly in order to make the same style show up on the frontend code.  

## Naming and Grouping
* All the elements within the input components must be contained within a group.
* The name of the group must contain the word`input`.
* The group **must** contains a rectangle (container of the input field box).

### Placeholders
* Placeholder text should be added within this group.
* The name of the text element needs to contain `placeholder`.

### Default Values
*  The default value of an input field can be set via the name of text in addition to `placeholder`.
* For example, with a default value of 1000, the name of the text element with the group would be '1000 placeholder'.
