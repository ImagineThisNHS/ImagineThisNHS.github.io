# Dropdown 

## Styling
The design typically includes a rectangular border and a downward icon to indicate other options visually. However, there are no strict rules for the dropdown's styling

## Naming & Grouping
* The whole dropdown selector must be a group
* This group's name must contain `dropdown`
* A dropdown group must only have one 'option'. This will be an option of the dropdown selector.
* The name of the dropdown option text should follow `option ChoiceHere` (blank space in between).


### Example of Naming & Grouping
The dropdown selector contains an option called “Football”. Therefore, the group name is dropdown, and it contains a text element named “option Football”.
