# Groups, Frames, and Components

```warning
Only Groups are currently supported by this tool. 

Frames and Components need to be changed to Groups to allow for conversion to useable code.
```
Similar to other design tools, groups in Figma allow you to combine multiple elements as a single top-level layer.

In your Figma design, itâ€™s possible that you also used two other functions that can combine many elements such as Frame and Component. However, these two combination methods are currently not support by this tool. Only Groups are currently supported.
