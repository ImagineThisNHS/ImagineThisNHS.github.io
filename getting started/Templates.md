# Templates and Examples

## Template of UI Elements
The UI template file aims to provide all components that are supported by Imagine This. These pre-prepared elements are set up to adhere to the guidelines of the software. From there, you can build out your designs from scratch or use it as a reference to how elements are constructed.

## Examples
Within this section, there are links to example Figma files. These files show a prototype design that can currently be used with Imagine This. A duplicate of the files can be made to your Figma account. This can be used as a template or starting point for your project.
