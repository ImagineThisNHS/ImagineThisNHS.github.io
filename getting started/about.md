## 1. ImagineThis V2: Rapid no-code application builder

Developing a mobile application is a time-consuming and manual process. Projects often require many weeksof development from their prototyping phase before a usable application is produced.

We propose the _ImagineThis_ tool, which takes anannotated high-fidelity prototype of a mobile user interface (UI) designed in Figma and converts it into codethat can run on both _iOS_ and _Android_. We achieved this by developing a Figma file parser, that iterates throughall layers of the Figma file, identifies components and extracts data. Then we use this information to feed intoour code generation algorithms, which output a complete React-Native project that can be compiled and runon both mobile platforms.
