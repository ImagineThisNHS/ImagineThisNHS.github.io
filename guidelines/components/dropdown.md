# Dropdown

If you need a dropdown selector within a view, you need to name the components in your UI design by following these rules:

1. The whole dropdown selector must be a group and the name of this group must contain “dropdown”.
2. A dropdown group must only have one “option”, which is an option of the drop-down radio box, and the name of the option text should be option+ blank space+ the option word. 

The drop-down radio box contains an option called “Football”, so the group name is dropdown, and it contains a text named “option Football”.

3. The design usually includes a rectangular border and a drop-down icon for the drop-down box, like xxxx, but our software recognizes these shapes, so it doesn't matter what they're named.
