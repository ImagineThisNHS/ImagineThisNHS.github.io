# Chart

## Styling
There is no strict styling requirements on chart, right now the only thing we can provide is a fixed/hardcoded chart right at the place where you want the chart putted. So don't bother with any configuration within it because there is nothing we can change about the chart except its width and height (which will be set according to the width and height of the group you called `chart` in the Figma). 

## Naming & Grouping
* The whole Chart must be a group
* This group's name must contain `chart`
* Don't bother setting the type of the chart or the data within because we cannot recognize any of these.

### Example of Naming & Grouping
The chart called "Calls made and Well-being". The program will recognize it as long as you call a Group with the name that contains word `chart`.
