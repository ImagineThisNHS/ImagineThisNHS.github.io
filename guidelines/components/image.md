# Images

## Styling
Images are mostly recognized as rectangles with the word `picture` contained in its name. You can also make it a group containing whatever you want to make it look better. But notice the image recognition can only take the group as a whole wireframe component and generate a whole picture out of it, separated components with in the image group will not be able to separated on the frontend. 

## Naming
* The image must be a rectangle or a group.
* Images must contain the word `picture` within it's name.
* There is no restrictions on the content within the group, but they will only be shown on the frontend as a whole picture.
