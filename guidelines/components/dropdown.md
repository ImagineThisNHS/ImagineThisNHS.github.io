# Dropdown 

## Styling
 The design usually includes a rectangular border and a downward icon to visually indicate other options.

## Naming & Grouping

Components will need to adhere to the following these rules:

1. The whole dropdown selector must be a group
2. This group's name must contain `dropdown`
3. A dropdown group must only have one 'option'. This will an option of the drop-down selector.
4. The name of the option text should follow `option ChoiceHere` (blank space in between).

### Example of Naming & Grouping
The drop-down selector contains an option called “Football”, so the group name is dropdown, and it contains a text named “option Football”.
