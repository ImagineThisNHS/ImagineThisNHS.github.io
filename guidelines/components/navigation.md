# Navigation Bar

## Styling
No styling requirements

## Naming & Grouping
The entire navigation bar should be organized into a group named "navigation bar".

Each button should be named according to the image button naming rules. For each of these buttons, they should be placed within their own seperate groups.

In addition to the group of each button, a rectangle is also required in the navigation bar.
